# WIN-Topology-IGT
Statistical Analysis of Structural Topology Measures and the IGT in the WIN Data


Step by Step Statistical Analysis of Structural Topology Measures and the IGT in the WIN Data
1. Calculate the Data Distribution (Boxplot statistics, Grubb's outliers, skewness
2. Calculate Generalized Linear Model for both Binary and Weighted
3. Calculate Correlation Matrix for both Binary and Weighted
4. Run Principal Component Regression with Standardized Data
5. Run Principal Component Analysis with Standardized Data
6. Run Singular Value Decomposition with Standardized Data
